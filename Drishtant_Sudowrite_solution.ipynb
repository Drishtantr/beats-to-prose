      "The lunar regolith crunched under Jack’s boots, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whine of Xander’s excavation drill.   Dust, fine as powdered glass, swirled around them, a grey halo in the perpetual sunlight.   Tension hung thick as the vacuum itself.   For weeks, they’d been chipping away at this seemingly unremarkable section of the Shackleton Crater, their hope a fragile seed planted in the barren, unforgiving soil.  \n",
      "\n",
      " The moon offered no comfort.   A desolate, cratered expanse stretching to the horizon, it was a landscape of stark beauty and absolute silence, broken only by the hiss of their life support systems and the mechanical rasp of the drill.   Isolation clung to them like the lunar dust, a palpable weight pressing down on their spirits.   The Earth, a distant blue marble, offered little solace.\n",
      "\n",
      " Then, the drill bit struck something hard.   Not the basalt they’d come to expect, but something… different.   Xander switched off the drill.   Slowly, painstakingly, they cleared away the surrounding regolith, revealing a metallic object, partially buried, unlike anything they’d ever seen. It pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence, a deep, ethereal blue that seemed to emanate from within its smooth, obsidian surface.   Intricate glyphs, unlike any terrestrial script, snaked across its surface. It was undeniably alien.\n",
      "\n",
      " Jack’s heart hammered against his ribs. Excitement warred with a profound unease. This wasn't just another lunar rock; this was a potential rewrite of human history.   The implications were staggering – scientific breakthroughs, geopolitical shifts, the possibility of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. But also, the potential for conflict. He fumbled for his comm unit.\n",

But, Jack, be careful. We don’t know what we’ve unearthed.\"   The undercurrent of worry in her voice was palpable.\n",
      "\n",
      " The silence returned, broken only by the rasp of their breaths and the ceaseless whisper of the windless lunar atmosphere.   They waited, the artifact humming faintly between them, a silent promise of revelations – and perhaps, danger.   The vastness of the lunar landscape pressed in on them, amplifying their isolation.   The cold, airless world felt both breathtaking and threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      " Jack’s gaze swept across the desolate expanse, a resolve hardening in his eyes. This discovery was his responsibility, and he would protect it, even from the voracious appetites of competing mining corporations, from those who would exploit it for personal gain. He could feel the whispers of betrayal already weaving through the vacuum of space, a chilling premonition of the obstacles that lay ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      " The artifact pulsed, the faint blue light intensifying, as if in response to their apprehension. Its secrets remained locked within, a tantalizing enigma wrapped in a shell of unknown power and potential peril.   A tremor, barely perceptible, ran through the lunar surface, a silent warning, perhaps, of what was to come. The dust, settling around the artifact, seemed to whisper untold stories.   The wait was agonizing, a stark prelude to a storm yet to break.\n",

      "The lunar regolith crunched under Jack Martinez’s boots, a brittle symphony in the oppressive silence.  Beside him, Xander, his second-in-command, wrestled with the excavation laser, its beam a thin, blue scar on the grey rock.  The Earth, a distant, vibrant jewel hanging in the inky void, offered no solace to their isolation. Tranquility Base was anything but; it was a tomb of ambition, a monument to mankind's hubris under the unforgiving gaze of the moon.\n",

It wasn't the dull grey of lunar rock, but a deep, obsidian black, polished to a mirror sheen.  As Xander chipped away the last vestiges of regolith, the object revealed itself – a perfect sphere, impossibly smooth, humming with an almost imperceptible energy.  Its surface pulsed faintly, like a dying star.\n",
      "\n",

      "The silence on the comm was broken only by the static hum of the base’s life support.  Then, Thorne’s voice, a fraction sharper, more urgent than before.  “Martinez, maintain visual contact.  Do not touch it.  I'm dispatching a retrieval team immediately.  What is the sector's proximity to the Helios Mining Consortium's claim?”\n",

      "Xander, his face etched with a mixture of awe and apprehension, stood beside Jack, his eyes wide.  The artifact seemed to throb subtly, a silent heartbeat in the dead lunar landscape.  The air – or rather, the lack of it – felt thick with unspoken tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "They waited, the silence amplified by the vastness of the lunar desert.  The distant whirring of the Helios mining drills became a sinister soundtrack to their isolation. The cold seeped into their bones, mirroring the creeping dread that threatened to consume them.  Jack's hand instinctively rested on his sidearm, a cold, metallic comfort in this desolate, alien world.  He knew this discovery was bigger than Helium-3, bigger than corporate greed.  It was a secret buried beneath the dust, a secret that could shatter the fragile peace of Earth… and possibly, unleash something far more terrifying.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The faint hum of the sphere intensified, a low, resonant thrum that seemed to vibrate within Jack's very skull.  And then, a shadow fell across the artifact, much larger and darker than the meager shelter of their excavation unit.  The shadow of something... else.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Any model with contextual understanding and multi-modal capabilities\n",
    "- Possibility: Fine-tuned language models for genre-specific prose\n",
    "- Architecture Design: Use of RAG for character/setting details\n",

    "## 2. If you need to procure data, how would you go about doing that? How would you prepare the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Procurement:\n",
    "- Publicly available data: Something like fiction genre corpora, character archetype databases, literary style archives.\n",
    "- I checked and it looks like I could get my hands on such data from:\n",
    "  - Gutenberg API\n",
    "  - Google Books Ngram Viewer API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation:\n",
    "- Tokenization: Convert text into manageable units\n",
    "- Embedding: Use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT) for contextual understanding\n",
    "- Classification: Classify text by genre, characters, or setting\n",
    "- Structured Metadata: Use metadata (e.g., character traits, setting descriptions, genres) to augment the model’s understanding\n",

    "1. Metadata Injection: Include character, setting, and genre information into the prompt\n",
    "2. Style-Specific Prompt Engineering: Tailor the prompt based on the type of prose (e.g., formal, casual, descriptive)\n",
    "3. Post-Generation Style Verification:\n",
    "   - Use tools like spaCy or NLTK to verify the prose style\n",
    "   - Ensure consistency with the desired literary style\n",
    "\n",
